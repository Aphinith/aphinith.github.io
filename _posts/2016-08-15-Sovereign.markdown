A curated site for independent film makers and documentarians to upload and showcase their works of art. Check it out [here](https://sovereign989.herokuapp.com)

I Architected Express-Webpack server and integrated it with React front-end, constructed platform for video file upload to AWS S3 and Neo4J for users to upload multiple videos. I also implemented front end design using React-Router to improve navigation for user experience. As scrum master, I defined scope of work, set achievable individual goals, and focused the team on deliverables. Check out the repo on my github account [here](https://github.com/Aphinith/Sovereign).
